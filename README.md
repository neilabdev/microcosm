# Microcosm

Allows extracting the minimum records necessary from production to create functional database by exporting a limited set of associated records using introspection and specified limits.

This means by specifying all tables or a specific record, the gem will walk the relational tree  exporting a maximum number of records from all associated models and their dependencies in the correct order as not to cause constraint violations when importing back into a new database.

The exports will be in a specified directory which you can alternatively zip and specify for import into a newly created database.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'microcosm', git: 'https://github.com/neilabdev/microcosm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Task Documentation
```shell
rake db:microcosm:export                               # Export Database Graph to YML files using all associated Models
rake db:microcosm:import_yml                           # Import YML model files created with :export task
rake db:microcosm:postgres:reset_sequence              # Reset Postgres PK sequences so autogenerated saves won't collide with existing record
rake db:microcosm:postgres:stop                        # stop
rake db:microcosm:reset                                # Reset database to db:schema:load in preparation for :import_yml
rake db:microcosm:to_fixtures                          # Convert development DB to Rails test fixtures
```

Export Database
```shell
rake db:microcosm:export CLASS=all LIMIT=1000 DIR=db/export VERBOSE=1
```

Import Database
